* Subtree Package
Subtree package is a package manager for Emacs that stores packages as Git
subtrees in a Git repository. The intention is for packages to be stored in the
Git repository for a user's Emacs configuration along with other settings. This
allows the entire configuration to be easily reproduced simply by cloning its
repository even if some of the repositories for packages it depends on no longer
exist.
